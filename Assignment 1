#Assignment 1 Description:

* Select five hosts of your choice in the Internet  and experiment with pinging each host 20 times at three different hours of the day. Check if there exist cases which
shows packet loss greater than 0% and provide reasoning. Pick one of the above used hosts and
repeat the experiment with different packet sizes from 64-bytes to 2048-bytes. Plot the average RTT
and explain how change in packet size and time of the day impacts RTT. 

* Perform traceroute experiment (with same hosts used in Q1) at three different hours of the day
to determine the routes used.

1. List out the hop counts for each host in each time slot. Determine the common hops between
two routes if they exist.
2. Check and explain the reason if route to same host changes at different times of the day. 
3. Inspect the cases when traceroute does not find complete paths to some hosts and provide
reasoning.
4. Is it possible to find the route to certain hosts which fail to respond with ping experiment?
Give reasoning.

Q3. Use the tool iperf (https://iperf.fr/) for these experiments.
a) Use two computers (preferably one at your hostel and the other at the department) as a 
client and a server. Send TCP packets of one time write-buffer length for 8KB, 16KB, 
32KB, 64KB and 128KB, and report the observed bandwidth.
b) Using the same setup as above, send UDP packets of datagram size as 1400 bytes, 1600 
bytes, 1800 bytes, 2000 bytes and 2200 bytes, and report the observed bandwidth. 
c) Using the same setup as above with default one time write-buffer size, report the TCP
bandwidth for TCP window size as 100K, 200K, 300K and 400K.
